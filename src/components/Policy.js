            <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The purpose of this policy is to equip UNFPA regional offices, sub-regional offices,
                        field offices, and liaison offices (hereafter collectively referred to as “field
                        offices”) with the information and tools necessary in order to carry out their
                        asks in relation to establishing, maintaining, and operating office premises</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>PRINCIPLES OF UNFPA REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT POLICY</h2>
                <h3>Country Office Real Estate Management(COREM)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is required that all field office premises irrespective of funding source, and
                        location be registered in COREM. Office premises, which are provided free
                        of charge by the host government are also required to be registered in
                        COREM. In case there are project offices(s) apart from the main office, those
                        office(s) should also be recorded separately under the heading of ‘secondary
                        office’ in COREM. This policy and procedure document applies to both main
                        field office premises and project office premises also referred to as secondary
                        or sub-field offices</li>
                    <li>All data entry fields must be completed during registration before an office
                        can be accepted into COREM. Incomplete data entry fields or failure to
                        upload all required supporting documentation will result in the registration not
                        being complete.</li>
