            <h2>PRINCIPLES OF UNFPA REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT POLICY</h2><br/>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this policy is to equip UNFPA regional offices, sub-regional offices,
                field offices, and liaison offices (hereafter collectively referred to as “field
                offices”) with the information and tools necessary in order to carry out their
               asks in relation to establishing, maintaining, and operating office premises</p>
            <h3>Country Office Real Estate Management(COREM)</h3>
            <p>
            It is required that all field office premises irrespective of funding source, and
            location be registered in COREM. Office premises, which are provided free
            of charge by the host government are also required to be registered in
            COREM. In case there are project offices(s) apart from the main office, those
            office(s) should also be recorded separately under the heading of ‘secondary
            office’ in COREM. This policy and procedure document applies to both main
            field office premises and project office premises also referred to as secondary
            or sub-field offices
            </p>
            <p>
            All data entry fields must be completed during registration before an office
            can be accepted into COREM. Incomplete data entry fields or failure to
            upload all required supporting documentation will result in the registration not
            being complete.
